kubectl describe pod <pod-name>: Displays detailed information about a specific pod, including events, conditions, and resource usage.
kubectl logs <pod-name>: Shows the logs from a specific pod's container. Use --previous to view logs from a crashed container.

kubectl create -f <filename.yaml>: Creates resources defined in a YAML file.
kubectl delete -f <filename.yaml>: Deletes resources defined in a YAML file.
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>: Deletes a specific pod.
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>: Deletes a specific deployment.
kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>: Restarts a deployment.
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=N: Scales a deployment to a specified number of replicas.
## Troubleshooting and Interaction:
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh: Opens an interactive shell within a running container in a pod.
kubectl port-forward svc/<service-name> <local-port>:<container-port>: Forwards a local port to a port on a service or pod, allowing local access to a service running in the cluster.
kubectl top pods: Shows resource usage (CPU/memory) for pods (requires Metrics Server).
kubectl config use-context <context-name>: Switches to a different Kubernetes context.
